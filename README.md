# Stock Market Data Analysis, Visualization, and Best Predictive Models Development

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing historical stock market data for four major companies: Nike, Adidas, PepsiCo, and Sony. The aim is to clean and explore the data, develop predictive models, and create interactive dashboards to provide insights into stock performance and trends.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/john-121/Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Best-Predictive-Models-Development.git>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Best-Predictive-Models-Development`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Clean the data: - Run the data cleaning script or use the Jupyter notebook to clean the datasets and save the cleaned data files.
5.  Upload cleaned data to GitHub: - Stage and commit your cleaned data files. - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.
6. We performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the stock data of Nike, Adidas, PepsiCo, and Sony. Below are the detailed steps:#Univariate Analysis - **Summary Statistics:** Generated summary statistics for each stock's price data. - **Visualizations:** - **Line Charts:** Visualized stock prices over time. - **Box Plots:** Displayed the distribution of stock prices. ### Bivariate Analysis - **Correlation Analysis:** Analyzed the correlations between stock prices of Nike, Adidas, PepsiCo, and Sony. - **Heatmap:** Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap. ### Price vs. Trading Volume Analysis - **Volume Conversion:** Converted trading volume data from string format to numeric values. - **Correlation Analysis:** Calculated the correlation between price and trading volume for each stock. - **Visualizations:** - **Scatter Plots:** Visualized the relationship between price and trading
