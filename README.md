# Stock Market Data Analysis, Visualization, and Best Predictive Models Development

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing historical stock market data for four major companies: Nike, Adidas, PepsiCo, and Sony. The aim is to clean and explore the data, develop predictive models, and create interactive dashboards to provide insights into stock performance and trends.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/john-121/Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Best-Predictive-Models-Development.git>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Best-Predictive-Models-Development`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Clean the data: - Run the data cleaning script or use the Jupyter notebook to clean the datasets and save the cleaned data files.
5.  Upload cleaned data to GitHub: - Stage and commit your cleaned data files. - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.
6. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): - Summary statistics: `nike_data.describe()`, `adidas_data.describe()`, `pepsi_data.describe()`, `sony_data.describe()` - Data visualization: Use libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize trends and patterns in the data. - Correlation analysis: `nike_data.corr()`, `adidas_data.corr()`, `pepsi_data.corr()`, `sony_data.corr()` - Feature engineering: Create new features, such as moving averages and volatility, to enhance predictive modeling.
